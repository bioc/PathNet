Depends: R (>= 1.14.0)
Description: PathNet uses topological information present in pathways and 
 differential expression levels of genes (obtained from microarray experiment) 
 to identify pathways that are 1) significantly enriched and 2) associated 
 with each other in the context of differential expression. The algorithm is 
 described in: PathNet: A tool for pathway analysis using topological 
 information. Dutta B, Wallqvist A, and Reifman J. Source Code for
